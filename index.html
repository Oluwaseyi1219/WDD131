        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>DevPortfolio Pro is a professional showcase platform designed to highlight web development skills, projects, and technical expertise. This site serves as a comprehensive portfolio and blog where visitors can explore interactive project demonstrations, read technical articles, and learn about modern web development practices through real-world examples.</p>

        <h3>Dynamic Elements</h3>
        <p>The site will feature extensive JavaScript functionality including: a dynamic project filter system using array methods (filter, map, reduce) to sort projects by technology stack; an interactive blog with search capabilities and tag filtering; a contact form with real-time validation and conditional error messaging; a theme switcher with localStorage persistence; project showcase with modal galleries; and a skills progress animation system. All features will utilize ES6 modules for organized code structure, object-oriented programming for data management, and comprehensive DOM manipulation with event listeners for user interactions.</p>
